# FLDIGI installation scripts and notes

FLDIGI is a digital mode software for ham radio developed by David Freese (callsign W1HKJ) since 2007. See www.w1hkj.com and www.arrl.org/nbems for more information.

This repository contains my personal notes and scripts for installing fldigi from the source code on a newly formatted PC with Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver installed.
