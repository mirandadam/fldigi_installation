# FLDIGI installation scripts and notes

FLDIGI is a digital mode software for ham radio developed by David Freese (callsign W1HKJ) since 2007. See www.w1hkj.com and www.arrl.org/nbems for more information.

This repository contains my personal notes and scripts for installing fldigi from the source code on a newly formatted PC with Ubuntu 18.04.1 Bionic Beaver installed.

## Using the 'installer'

Run the scripts in the order that they are numbered.

Scripts _0_install_packages.sh_ and _3_install_fldigi.sh_ need to be run with superuser privileges.
